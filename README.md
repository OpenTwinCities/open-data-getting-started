## 2) Help curate/create open data

* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/): Visit [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/) for an introduction to the OpenStreetMap project, or check out the [beginners' guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) to learn how to start contributing to OpenStreetMap.

Or, visit [Harvard Law School Library's guide](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/wikipedia) on how to contribute to Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.  There's also a nice [WikiHow article](https://www.wikihow.com/Contribute-to-Wikipedia) outlining some of the contribution tasks you can engage in.
